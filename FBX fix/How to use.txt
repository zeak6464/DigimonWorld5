How to import animation fbx:

use FBXSetting.exe by drag a FBX file to it 
when open it will ask for how many Frames the FBX contains based on 60 Frames per sec

Make sure The Base Model & the Rest of the FBX files share the same bones

Make a new folder called motion , and make sure to put your animations that you
want to use in there. 

make sure the Motion folder is with the Rest of the model file (same bones) & texture folder.
